:: Step 1: Get the path of the batch file
set "current_dir=%~dp0"
set "log_file=%current_dir%script_log.txt"

:: Create or clear the log file
echo ==== Script Execution Log (Started at %DATE% %TIME%) ==== > "%log_file%"

:: Function to log and display messages
call :log "Debug: The batch file is located at: %current_dir%"

:: Step 2: Define the path to the global_variables.ini file
set "ini_file=%current_dir%cnf\global_variables.ini"
