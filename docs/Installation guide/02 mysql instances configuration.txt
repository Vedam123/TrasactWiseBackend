Instances creation instructions after MySQL is installed and create all these with Administrator privileges

SAS Product directory : C:\SAS Opera\Companies  in which 
YOu can see directories for each company for example I have the below
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1

Under each company directory  ( for example Company_0)
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\AppService
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\application\WebClient
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance\cnf
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema\scripts
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema\scripts\create
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\schema\scripts\delete
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances  ( Here I create 4 instances in this case )
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance0 
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance2
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance3

The data file will be located in each instance for example in case of instance1 it will be
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1\data
when installed the data directory as per the below steps you can see a file DELPHI-K.err in the data directory in which you can find root password
2024-12-11T20:34:14.665632Z 6 [Note] [MY-010454] [Server] A temporary password is generated for root@localhost: :bfXda>*=9jk
you can change the password for the root user later
connect mysql and create a new user and create the file below with that info
C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1
Create the file .instance.cnf under instance1 folder  with the following content
[client]
user=vedamc0in1
password=welcome
host=localhost
port=3312

Now you need to update my.ini file which is in the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1


In order to create all the above follow the steps 

1. In Companies folder create another folder called Company_2
2. In the Company_2 folder create a system directory 
3. In the system directory create application , config, db_instances directories  (other directories are optional docs, ext_resources, logs, reports etc.. )
4. Now under config directory create two more directories (instance, schema)
5. Under instance directory create a cnf directory
6. Under schema directory create scripts directory
7. Under scripts directory create two directories create, delete
8. Place all the .sql files  (from 000_create_schemas.sql to 0014_fin_purchase_invoice_tables.sql) in create directory
9. In delete directory place 0000_delete_schemas.sql
10. Place the follwoing 4 .py , .bat files in schema directory 
     create_scehmas_py.py, create_schemas_bat.bat, delete_schemas_bat.bat, delete_schemas_py.py

Now do the following

 1. Creatae the instances directories  ( the number of instance you need ) manually or run the 01create_instance_folders which is in the config folder.
	a. Go to cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config
	b. Run the file 01create_instance_folders
	c. This will create the following 4 directories 
		C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance0 
		C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1
		C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance2
		C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance3
	d. Also it create data , logs , uploads directories as well.
	
 2. Now to setup one Particular instance say instance1 of Company_1 you can do the following 
	a. Copy file my.ini from from C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0  TO C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1 folder (e,g instance1) OR
	b. OR Go to cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config and run the file 02_copy_config_file.bat
 3. Carefully modify the my.ini file in the directory C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1
	Select a port carefully one example my.ini file is attached here with for instance 
	Example changed my.ini file for instance0 is attached here with the port 3307 in the same folder where these instructions are present  ( may be you can use different port 3322 in this case for example )
	This is partly automated by the batch file but it is not fully functioning , can be improved in fture C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config\03_change_myini_manually.bat
 4.Now initialize Data folder which is key after successflly done you can see root password in order to login to database
	a. for instance 1 , run the command mysqld --initialize --datadir=C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1  OR
	b. OR run the batch file 04_initialize_data_folder from the directory  cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config
	c. In this particular case the root password was in the file DELPHI-K.err in the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1\data
	
 5. YOu can continue the same for all the instances , now it is is the time to create services if it is in windows machine
	a. for instance1  mysqld --install VEDAM_instance1 --defaults-file=C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\db_instances\instance1\my.ini
	b. OR run batch file 05_create_services from the folder cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config
	
 6. Now to start the service 
	a. net start VEDAM_instance1
	b. OR Run the batch file 06_start_services.bat which is in the folder cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config

 7. Now connect to mysql with root password from the Step 4 to change and to create a new user to use by application to configure .instance.cnf file as in below steps
	a. mysql -u root -p -P 3312
		ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome';
		CREATE USER 'vedamc0in1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome';
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'vedamc0in1'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	b. mysql -u root -p -P 3322
		ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome';
		CREATE USER 'vedamc1in1'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'welcome';
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'vedamc1in1'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
	
 8. create .instance.cnf file in the folder for example in the instance1 C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\db_instances\instance1 and it can have the following details 
	[client]
	user=vedamc0in1
	password=welcome
	host=localhost
	port=3312
	An example file is attached here with 
 8a. Also it is important to create the global_variables.ini file in the folder C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance\cnf with the following content
	[Global]
	COMPANY=Company_0
	SOURCE_FILE=C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\my.ini
	MYSQL_BIN=C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
	BASE_PATH=C:\SAS Opera\Companies00_config.ini file with the following information 

 8b. Also it is important to create the following 00_config.ini file in the folder path C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_0\system\config\instance\cnf w with the following content 

	[MySQL]
	Company=Company_0
	gcname=GCompany_0
	name=Company_0
	instances=3
	base_port=3306

	port0=3311
	port1=3312
	port2=3313
	port3=33130
	
	The port0 represents for the port of instance0 and similarly continues and it is infact associated with my.ini file so carefully configure both 8a, 8b steps.



Optionally you can also use the following steps to Stop or Remove services

 9. Now to stop the services 
	a. 	# To Stop the service is running   --> 	net stop VEDAM_instance1
	b. OR Run the batch file 07_stop_services.bat which is in the folder cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config
	
 10. Now to remove the services 
	a. # Remove the service   --> mysqld --remove VEDAM_instance1
	b. OR Run the batch file 08_Remove_services.bat which is in the folder cd C:\SAS Opera\Companies\Company_1\system\config
